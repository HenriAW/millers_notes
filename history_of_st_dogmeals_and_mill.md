# Histroy of St Dogmeals and renovations of the mill

I was very flattered to be asked to give an account of the renovation of St. Dogmaels Mill. I have some slides to show you but first I’ll give a brief history of the mill and a little of the history of the village of St. Dogmaels.

The village of St. Dogmaels lies on the southern side of the River Teifi about 1 mile distant from the market town of Cardigan. The village is partly in the Ceredigion (formerly Cardiganshire) and partly in Preseli (formerly Pembrokeshire) now all lumped together with part of Carmarthenshire into the county of Dyfed. The mill stream, in fact, forms part of the boundary between Cardiganshire and Pembrokeshire, the mill lying in Pembrokeshire.

St Dogmell lived in the 5th C.A.D. between 459 and 500 and the name Dogmell probably coming from the Latin. Dog from Doctus meaning learned (hence Doctor) and Mael meaning Artisan therefore skilled or learned craftsmen (stone or metal worker). It is thought there was a 6th C Abbey, of which no trace remains, about 1 mile distant from the present Abbey ruins.

Moving quickly now to 1087, Cardiganshire was given to a knight, Martin of the Towers, or Martin de Tours, by Williams the Conqueror as a reward for helping William during his conquest of Britain. Martin of the Towers was so called because of the 3 towers emblazoned on his shield and banner. A few years later William further granted him a portion of Pembrokeshire if he could subdue it. 

Martin of the Towers landed at Fishguard with his men meeting slight resistance which he easily overcame each chillage thereafter meekly surrendering until he reached the village of Eglwyswiw. Here the only real fight occurred. There being but a handful of Welsh they were soon defeated and he continued north to St. Dogmaels, all the villages including St. Dogmaels surrendering. Most fortunately Martin was a good man, both humane and just--a rarity in those days. Martin now settled peacefully in Pembrokeshire and approaching his last days turned his thoughts to religion deciding to build an Abbey at St. Dogmaels. He began to make plans for the Abbey but died before work commenced.

Soon after Martin’s death, his eldest son Robert who succeeded him, set to work and caused the Abbey to be built. He may have looked on it as a trust, imposed upon him by his father building, it is thought, according to his father’s plans. The Abbey was completed in 1118 and Robert arranged with William of Tiren Abbey in France to take an Abbot and 13 monks for the new Abbey of St. Dogmaels. The Abbey being of the order of reformed Benedictines. Apparently Roberts, who is described as a most noble man of holy life, had previously, in 113, taken 13 monks with him for the Priory of St. Dogmaels. Obviously he was not superstitious. 

The monks now took over the Abbey and I know no more of Robert. However, some time later, and I do not know when, the mill was built. It was certainly in existence in 1648 as a record was found in The National Library of Wales in the Noyadd Trefawr collection, Noyadd Trefawr being a large local estate of the period. In 1819 the mill was in the ownership of a William Webley Parry who substantially rebuilt it and installed the present machinery. Again from the National Library of Wales we have several letters of the period in one of which, dated 1825, he says “It will be impossible to go to the expense of the French Mill, it certainly will not answer to lay of £500. It will be requisite to have very good and well seasoned timbers and some iron wheels which is now increased double in its price, the price is now wonderful. We therefore must be satisfied, I fear, to make it a common mill of the best kind”. It must have been of the best kind as the machinery survives to this day and would seem to be good for another 161 years. 

Briefly, as you will see in the slides, the mill is a 3 storey building powered by a 15 foot diameter overshot waterwheel. The millpond, covering about ½ an acre, provides the water for the wheel being supplied with water itself by a small stream called Afen Degwel. The tail race is discharged into the river Teifi about 150 yards downstream from the mill.

The mill changed hands several times until in 1888 it was bought by a family named Gwynne. It was worked by the Gwynnes until, to the best of our knowledge, it fell into disuse in the mid 1930’s, the miller dying in 1926. The business was carried on by his sister into the 1930’s and it may have worked briefly during WWII. It was certainly not maintained properly over its later years as evidenced by the main bearing. How the waterwheel managed to turn in an egg shaped bearing still surprises me! 

During 1953/4 the millpond was filled in using the excavated material from St. Dogmaels Abbey which was by now under the care of the Ministry of Works. The millpond, lying stagnancy for 20 years or so, provided an ideal dumping ground eventually being levelled off and providing a small field, the millstream running to the side of the field. The mill was left untouched being used as a storeroom for coal, lime and general rubbish which fell into the category of “it may come in useful some day”. Old bedsteads, window frames, empty boxes, that sort of thing. 

We came across the mill in 1974. To be precise we came across the mill house. My wife and I, together with our 2 daughters, had been living in Teheran where I was employed by an American Company. Two years of endless sun made us yearn for some rain and green fields. Pembrokeshire, where we had spent several family holidays had happy memories for us so we decided to sell our house near Chester and move to the Cardigan area. Accordingly we visited Cardigan looking for a job and a house. I was fortunate to be offered a job by a local businessman who was setting up a dairy produce distribution business. My wife saw what proved to be the mill house in an estate agent’s window and said “That is the house I want”. We went to see it and I was appalled. One cold tap, electricity in 2 rooms only, no bathroom,  almost all the windows broken, unfortunately boys will be boys and an outside loo. No backdoor, all the downstairs windows at the back of the house almost completely hidden by what proved to be the millpond wall. A gap of about one foot between the millpond wall and the house. The house being built facing Northwest seemed very dark and had not really been lived in for 7 or 8 years the owner having died about 3 years previously. 

However, wives being wives we bought it together with the, so called, mill pond with the idea of turning it into a garden. Having been filled from the Abbey it proved to be very stony ground and any digging invariably brought us into contact with a buried wall or sluice gate. I started work on the new job and we set to work on the house. 

Two years later we had spent all the money saved in Iran on the house but now had a 4 bedroomed house complete with bathroom and plumbed and wired throughout. We had dug out the pond wall and created a patio at the back of the house. I had a geographical knowledge of Cardiganshire and Pembrokeshire second to none and didn’t want to see yogurt for a long time. Out of the blue, or to be more exact, out of a little red van, came a telegram from Iran. They were expanding and would I be interested in going back for an 18 month contract. A wet spring in Wales and the endless sunshine of Iran did not seem so bad. We returned to Teheran in August 1976.

In 1977 the estate agent, from whom we had bought the house and who was handling the renting of it wrote and asked would we be interested in buying the mill. Next door to the house and if bought by A.N. Other would produce endless “rights of way” problems. We made an offer and to our surprise it was accepted. Apparently the estate of the late Phoebe Mary James (née Gwynne) could not be finalised until everything was sold. One of the trustees had died and the beneficiaries were eager to finalise the estate without more ado. We were suddenly the owners of a derelict mill.

That summer we visited our mill and wondered what to do with it. We measured it, drew it, photographed it and thought about it. We returned to Iran and decided to renovate the mill. Accordingly I signed another 18 month contract to raise enough money for the renovation. In Teheran we had been hearing of an exile in Iraq called Khomeini soon to be elevated to the rank of Ayatollah. The rest of that period is history. We left Iran 6 months prior to the conclusion of my second contract on an RAF VC10. Although it was not possible to stay in Iran the Iranians decided we had broken our contract so could not expect the various benefits accrued. We were about £15,000 short of our expected earnings, bonuses etc. not being paid but happy to be safely home.

I started to look seriously at the mill. The pond was nonexistent, the tailrace had been filled in, only a 3” drain pipe remaining as evidence. The waterwheel was a skeleton showing several breaks in the iron work and the whole end of the mill and wheel was covered in ivy. Attractive to look at, it was lifting some of the roof slates and blocking what was left of the downspouts and guttering. Inside, the machinery was collapsed, a lot of woodwork had provided a woodworms banquet and every mill’s friend, Roland Rat, had been very active. I began writing away for grants and clearing the obvious rubbish out of the mill. One of my brothers, down on holiday, was coerced into digging test holes in the millpond field to locate the sides and bottom of the pond. 5 holes later, approximately 4 feet square by 6 feet deep we knew the extent of the pond and my brother returned home-- we have not had other than a flying visit from him since.

Another brother appeared, I have a fairly inexhaustible supply of relatives, and he and I set to work to dig out the pond area leading to the sluice gate, a distance of 10 or so yards by 2-3 yards wide, one of the slides shows the area, and about 6 feet deep. We succeeded and the brother returns regularly still keen to help!

I also began to dig out the tailrace but I think now I will start to show the slides and try to explain what work was relevant to each slide.
